# Sum-Check protocol

A rust implementation of the Sum check protocol as devised by Justin Thaler on Proofs, Arguments, and Zero-Knowledge.

The Sum check protocol is a fundamental tool in verifiable computing. It allows to prove interactively to a verifier the computation of the boolean hypercube on some multivariate polynomial over a finite field. This result translates into many settings in the mark of verifiable computation.

This is one of my first experiences with Rust so the code might be far from optimal.
